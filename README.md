# Important note

At current time of writing, this is a component API experiment -- the validation support etc. **is extremely naive and not ready for production**.

# How to test this out

I haven't published this or anything yet, you can try it out by cloning this repo and running:

`npm start`

# Guide

Using this form library, you can

* Create forms with a schema, including validations
* Link inputs in child components back to the form
* Handle submitting and showing errors with helper components
* Get the "valid" or "submit attempt" state of the entire form at any time
